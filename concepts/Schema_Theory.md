- Previously collected knowledge is used to make sense of new knowledge
- Everyone has a schema and it is completely unique
- Schema can affect 3 stages of memory process; encoding, storage, and retrieval
- Schemas can create distorted memories
- How we organize information, if something is unknown we fill it with something we already know (in our schema)
