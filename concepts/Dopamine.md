Neurotransmitter that sends messages about pleasure, mood, and movement. When pleasurable things are experienced neurons containing dopamine release their dopamine and these dopamine neurotransmitters pass this message on to the dendrites of other neurotransmitters.


This takes place in an area of the brain called the reward pathway. The reward pathway: a central part of the brain from the brain stem to the front of the cerebral cortex. The reward pathway is stimulated by pleasurable activities as well as drugs.


Long term use of a drug like cocaine causes the brain to lose receptors. That means it is much harder for an addict to feel pleasure from everyday activities. The addict must take more of the drug just to feel any effect.
