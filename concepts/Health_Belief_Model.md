
# Health Belief Model


Used to predict whether a person will choose to engage in healthy behavior. Sees people as rational.


### Healthiness is dictated by:


1.	Evaluation of threat – people only act if they perceive a threat
2.	Cost benefit analysis – If benefit outweighs barrier, actions will be taken, and vice versa


### Strengths:


-	HBM includes that if one believes in themselves, they will do it
-	Increased confidence, increased performance (people are very optimistic of their own health)


### Limitations:


-	Focuses on individual cognition; no external factors considered.
-   People not always rational and people can be unrealistically optimistic about health
