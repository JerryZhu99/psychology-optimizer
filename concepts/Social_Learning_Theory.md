## What it is:


People learn by watching models and imitating behavior.


## 4 Conditions:


1.	Attention: the person must pay attention to the model
2.	Retention: the observer must be able to remember the behavior that has been observed
3.	Motor reproduction: the observer has to be able to replicate the action
4.	Motivation: Learners must want to demonstrate what they have learned.
    - Identification with model
    - Reward/Punishment
