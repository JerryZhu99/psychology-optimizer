        "Aim":"To investigate if schema processing influences encoding and retrieval of information.",
        "Method":"Experiment, with IV being the schema given, burglar or house buyer, and DV being the recall of details in the story.",
        "Procedure":"Participants were given a schema, burglar or house buyer. They were told a story, and then given a 12 min distraction task. They were then asked to recall the story, and given another distraction task. Half were then given the other schema and asked to recall the story again.",
        "Results":"Participants in changed schema had recalled  7% more points in second recall. This shows that schema has an effect on encoding and retrieval.",
        "Strengths":"This study has a cause-effect relationship, maximum control over variables, and established statistical significance.",
        "Limitations":"This study has no ecological validity, and participants recalled irrelevant information"

        "Procedure":"American and Ghanian university students were orally told \"War of the Ghosts\" twice. After waiting 16 days, they were asked to write down what they remembered.",
        "Results":"The university students from Ghana recalled more of the themes and words of the story, as they learned orally. This shows how culture influences memory.",
        "Strengths":"This study has ecological validity as they were in a school environment, was culturally diverse, and has a cause and effect relationship.",

        "Procedure":"Participants were split into two groups, one received no sleep for 35 hours and the other received a normal night of sleep. The next day, they watched a slideshow with 150 slides while under an fMRI. After a night of sleep, they were shown again with new slides mixed in and asked to identify if they had seen the slides before.",
