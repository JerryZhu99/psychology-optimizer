        "Procedure":"Watched children playing (21-25 months).",
        "Results":"Boys made fun of boys that played with girls and vice versa. Boys did not like boys that played with girls or girl toys. Girls did not like girls who played with boys or boy toys. (Competitive behavior).\n\t“In group” – same gender – boost self-esteem (social belonging)\n\t“Out group” – other gender. Peer pressure in gender groups. Similar pressure among older children",
        "Strengths":"Ecological validity, less demand characteristics",
        "Limitations":"No max control, no cause-effect."
